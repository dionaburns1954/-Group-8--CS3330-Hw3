To run this program please clone the repository and run the Main class which can be located as 'edu.mu.main.Main'. The Main class demonstrates the usage of the inventory management system by performing different operations such as initializing the stock, updating the price, adding and removing items, printing out a list of the media products, and much more.

For this project to work properly you need to make sure that the CSV file, which has the media information on it, has the data types: Type, Title, Price, Year, and Genre in each column.

The team members that worked on this project are Albert Zhou, Dion Burns, Logan Bird, and Ryan Esparza.
